# DNA Sequence Simulation â€“ Proteus Circuit Project

This is a DNA Sequence Simulation project created on Circuit Simulation. The simulation was developed using the Proteus design software, where digital components are used to represent and simulate a simplified DNA sequencing process.

## Project Highlights
- Developed using Proteus 8.x
- Simulates the logic behind DNA sequencing through circuit components
- Demonstrates the use of logic gates, flip-flops, and counters (depending on design)
- Useful for understanding the intersection of biology and digital logic

## Tools Used
- Software: Proteus (Labcenter Electronics)
- File type: `.pdsprj`, `.pds`, etc.

## How to Run
1. Open the project in Proteus (version 8 or higher recommended)
2. Load the `.pdsprj` workspace file
3. Run the simulation to observe circuit behavior
